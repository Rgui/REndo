\title{Fitting Linear Models with 1 Endogenous Regressor using Latent Instrumental Variables}
\usage{
liv(formula, param)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{var1 ~ var2     var1: vector or matrix containing the dependent variable. var2: a vector with the endogenous variable.}

\item{param}{- a vector of initial values for the parameters of the model to be supplied to the optimization algorithm.
The first parameter is the intercept, then the coefficient of the endogenous variable followed by the means of the two groups of the latent IV,
then the next three parameters are for the variance-covariance matrix. The last parameter is the probability for group 1.}
}
\value{
It returns the optimal values of the parameters as computed by maximum likelihood using BFGS algorithm. To obtain the
standard errors bootsptrapping is needed, using the boots() function from the same package.
\item{coefficients}{returns the value of the parameters for the intercept and the endogenous regressor as computed with maximum likelihood.}
\item{means}{returns the value of the parameters for the means of the two categories/groups of the latent instrumental variable.}
\item{sigma}{returns the variance-covariance matrix sigma, where on the main diagonal are the variances of the structural error and that of
the endogenous regressor and the off-diagonal terms are equal to the covariance between the errors.}
\item{probabilityG1}{returns the probability of group 1. Since the model assumes that the latent instrumental variable has two groups,
1-probabilityG1 gives the probability of group 2.}
\item{value}{the value of the log-likelihood function corresponding to param.}
\item{convergence}{An integer code, the same as the output returned by optim. 0 indicates successful completion. A possible error code is 1 which dicates that the iteration
limit maxit had been reached.}
\item{hessian}{A symmetric matrix giving an estimate of the Hessian at the solution found.}

\description{
Fits linear models with one endogenous regressor and no additional explanatory variables using the latent instrumental variable approach
presented in Ebbes,P., Wedel,M., Boeckenholt, U., and Steerneman, A. G. M. (2005). This is a statistical technique to address the endogeneity problem where no external instrumental
variables are needed. The important assumption of the model is that the latent variables are discrete with at least two groups with different means and
the structural error is normally distributed.
}
\details{
The method has been programmed such that the latent variable has two groups. Ebbes et al.(2005) show in a Monte Carlo experiement that
even if the true number of the categories of the instrument is larger than two the LIV estimates are approximately consistent. Besides, overfitting in terms
of the number of groups/categories reduces the degrees of freedom and leads to efficiency loss. For a model with additonal explanatory variables a Bayesian approach is needed, since
in a frequentist approach identification issues appear. The optimization algorithm used is BFGS.
